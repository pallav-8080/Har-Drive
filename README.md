# Application Details

## Functional Requirements

The application supports the following features - 

1. Users can upload files and folders by dragging and dropping or by using a file upload menu.
2. Users can edit file names.
3. Users can drag and move files into folders.
4. Users can delete any files or folders.
5. Users can switch between grid view and table view.
6. Users can preview a file without downloading it.

## Non-Functional Requirements 

Following NFRs have been targeted to ensure reliability of the application

1. __Modularity__ - The application is built with small and reusable code modules (components as known in React). The components are structured using the Atomic Design Principle, making it easy for any developer to extend and update the codebase freely.
2. __Security__ - Since this application collects data from a user's system, security is a critical NFR. A virus-infected file can lead to data loss for the user and sacrifice the application server as well. To ensure the security of both the application and the user, we use a 3rd party module that scans for viruses before uploading files.
3. __Robustness__ - The application has proper error handling to handle edge cases. Yet in case it breaks, the user will still be able to see the uploaded files and access file-related operations. Since there is no backend to the application, we use the browser storage to save the state of the data room and in the event of failures load it back using ReactContext.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
